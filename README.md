# ü§ñ Agentic RAG Chatbot

An intelligent, agent-based chatbot designed to answer questions directly from your uploaded documents, whether it‚Äôs a PDF, PPTX, CSV, DOCX, or TXT. This project brings together Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), OpenAI‚Äôs language models, and modular agent architecture to make document-based Q&A seamless and efficient.

## üöÄ What It Does

Have a bunch of files but no time to dig through them? Just upload your documents, ask a question, and the chatbot will:
1. Parse and understand the documents,
2. Retrieve the most relevant sections,
3. Generate a helpful, context-aware answer using OpenAI.

This is more than just a chatbot, it‚Äôs a practical research assistant for working with multi-format documents.

## üß† Architecture Overview

This system is built on a **modular agentic framework**:

- **IngestionAgent**: Parses and preprocesses uploaded documents.
- **RetrievalAgent**: Embeds content using sentence-transformers and retrieves semantically relevant chunks via FAISS.
- **LLMResponseAgent**: Generates an answer using OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo`, based on the retrieved context.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: All agents communicate via structured messages, maintaining clean separation and traceability.

Each agent handles a well-defined responsibility, making the system more scalable and maintainable.
